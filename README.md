# Editor-with-Java-Compiler
I have made this Notepad Editor with a small java Compiler , which compiles a .java file code to byte code and store it in a .class file.
This editor comprised with two option one can find it by clicking on 'New' Menu under File Menu.
I know that it is not a very big thing, but as i m a rookie so i m happy by doing this , and i always try to learn something new .I also hope that my program will help to all new java learners.
If anyone have any queries that ask me on vishalvarshney62@yahoo.in .
Thank you!!
